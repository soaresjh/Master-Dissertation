This paper categorizes applications of NLO into three areas: improving lasers, interaction with materials, and information technology. NLO provides: coherent light of different wavelengths; multi-photon absorption for plasma-materials interaction; advanced spectroscopy and materials analysis; and applications to communications and sensors. Applications in information processing and storage seem less mature.},

abstract = {Optical frequency combs serve as the clockwork of optical clocks, which are now the best time-keeping systems in existence. The use of precise optical time and frequency technology in various applications beyond the research lab remains a significant challenge, but one that integrated microresonator technology is poised to address. Here, we report a silicon-chip-based microresonator comb optical clock that converts an optical frequency reference to a microwave signal. A comb spectrum with a 25\&\#xA0;THz span is generated with a 2\&\#xA0;mm diameter silica disk and broadening in nonlinear fiber. This spectrum is stabilized to rubidium frequency references separated by 3.5\&\#xA0;THz by controlling two teeth 108 modes apart. The optical clock\&\#x2019;s output is the electronically countable 33\&\#xA0;GHz microcomb line spacing, which features stability better than the rubidium transitions by the expected factor of 108. Our work demonstrates the comprehensive set of tools needed for interfacing microcombs to state-of-the-art optical clocks.},

abstract = {Third-harmonic generation can be realized via both $\chi^{(3)}$ and cascaded $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear processes in a triply-resonant microcavity. It is still unknown how these processes interfere with each other and the optimization of the conversion efficiency still remains as a question. In this work, the interplay between the direct third-harmonic generation and the cascaded process combining of the second-harmonic generation and the sum-frequency generation are investigated. It is found that the interference effect between these two processes can be used to improve the conversion efficiency. By optimizing the cavity resonance and the external coupling conditions, the saturation of the nonlinear conversion is mitigated and the third-harmonic conversion efficiency is increased. A design rule is provided for achieving efficient third-harmonic generation in an optical microcavity, which can be generalized further to the high-order harmonic generations.},

abstract = {Nonlinear wavelength conversion is essential for many classical and quantum pho-tonic applications. The underlying second-order nonlinear optical processes, however, generally exhibit limited spectral bandwidths that impact their application potential. Here we use a high-Q X-cut lithium niobate microdisk resonator to demonstrate both second-harmonic generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion on chip. In particular, our lithium niobate microresonator, with its wide-range cyclic phase matching and rich optical mode structures, is able to achieve ultra-broadband spontaneous parametric down-conversion, with a bandwidth over 400 nm, inferred from recorded spectra of the down-converted photons. The produced biphoton pairs exhibit strong temporal correlation, with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio measured to be 43.1. Our device is promising for integrated quantum photonics where optical frequency could be used as a degree of freedom for signal processing.},

@article{Shikida2000,
abstract = {We compared the anisotropic etching properties of KOH and TMAH solutions. We used hemispherical specimens of single-crystal silicon whose surface exhibited every crystallographic orientation, in order to evaluate the etching properties as a function of the orientation. We carried out a series of experiments using different etchant concentrations and etching temperatures. The orientation dependence in the etching rates of the surface crystals significantly differed between the two etchants, especially for the (111) and (221) planes. We conclude that the two etchants have different etching mechanisms at least in an area including these two planes. The etching rates varied with etchant concentration and etching temperature. The concentrations that maximized the etching rate were 25 wt.{\%} for KOH and 20 wt.{\%} for TMAH. The activation energies in KOH and TMAH were almost the same for the (100), (110), and (320) planes but not for the (221) and (111) planes. Etchant circulation had a significant effect on the etching rates in diluted TMAH solution but not in KOH solution. The roughness of the (100) plane in KOH was one order smaller than that in TMAH.},

abstract = {A study of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) etching of silicon and the interaction of etching parameters has been carried out. We find that the silicon etch rate increases as the TMAH concentration increases and it reaches a maximum at 4 wt.{\%}. The etch rate of n-type silicon is found to be slightly higher than that of p-type silicon. We conclude that illumination has no effect on the etch rate with our present experimental set-up. Etching experiments on silicon oxide layers show that both wet and dry oxides etch faster in lowerTMAH concentration, and wet oxide generally etches faster than a dry oxide layer. A higher temperature also results in a higher etch rate for both the wet and dry oxides. From factorial analysis, we conclude that for silicon etching, the interaction between TMAH concentration and substrate type is the strongest. The silicon oxide etching experiments show that temperature is the most prominent factor and the most pronounced interaction exists between temperature and TMAH concentration.},

Phase mismatch prevents microscopic nonlinear sources from combining constructively, resulting in destructive interference and thus very low efficiency. We report the experimental demonstration of phase mismatch-free nonlinear generation in a zero-index optical metamaterial. In contrast to phase mismatch compensation techniques required in conventional nonlinear media, the zero index eliminates the need for phase matching, allowing efficient nonlinear generation in both forward and backward directions. We demonstrate phase mismatch-free nonlinear generation using intrapulse four-wave mixing, where we observed a forward-to-backward nonlinear emission ratio close to unity. The removal of phase matching in nonlinear optical metamaterials may lead to applications such as multidirectional frequency conversion and entangled photon generation.},

abstract = {Frequency comb generation in microresonators at visible wavelengths has found applications in a variety of areas such as metrology, sensing, and imaging. To achieve Kerr combs based on four-wave mixing in a microresonator, dispersion must be in the anomalous regime. In this work, we demonstrate dispersion engineering in a microbubble resonator (MBR) fabricated by a two-CO2 laser beam technique. By decreasing the wall thickness of the MBR down to 1.4 µm, the zero dispersion wavelength shifts to values shorter than 764 nm, making phase matching possible around 765 nm. With the optical Q-factor of the MBR modes being greater than 10 7 , four-wave mixing is observed at 765 nm for a pump power of 3 mW. By increasing the pump power, parametric oscillation is achieved, and a frequency comb with 14 comb lines is generated at visible wavelengths.},

In quantum optical devices, microcavities can coax atoms or quantum dots to emit spontaneous photons in a desired direction or can provide an environment where dissipative mechanisms such as spontaneous emission are overcome so that quantum entanglement of radiation and matter is possible.

abstract = {The control of dispersion in fibre optical waveguides is of critical importance to optical fibre communications systems1, 2 and more recently for continuum generation from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared3, 4, 5. The wavelength at which the group velocity dispersion crosses zero can be set by varying the fibre core diameter or index step2, 6, 7, 8. Moreover, sophisticated methods to manipulate higher-order dispersion so as to shape and even flatten the dispersion over wide bandwidths are possible using multi-cladding fibres9, 10, 11. Here we introduce design and fabrication techniques that allow analogous dispersion control in chip-integrated optical microresonators, and thereby demonstrate higher-order, wide-bandwidth dispersion control over an octave of spectrum. Importantly, the fabrication method we employ for dispersion control simultaneously permits optical Q factors above 100 million, which is critical for the efficient operation of nonlinear optical oscillators. Dispersion control in high-Q systems has become of great importance in recent years with increased interest in chip-integrable optical frequency combs},

abstract = {A systematic study on the effects of microtaper fiber diameters on the spectral characteristics of a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microbottle resonator (MBR) is presented. Progressively cleaner and simpler spectra of the MBR were observed when the utilized microtaper fiber waist diameter (Dt) was increased from 2 to 10 $\mu$m. The maximum transmission depth at resonance varies with different microtaper fiber utilized from ∼20 dB (Dt=2 $\mu$m) to ∼4 dB (Dt=10 $\mu$m). The loaded Q-factors were observed to be unaffected by the increase of Dt with values of {\textgreater}106 being measured in all cases. Mode transformation of MBR was also experimentally investigated and compared to a microdisc finite-difference time-domain simulation by studying near-field images of the output beam on the waist of the microtaper fibers. For the first time, experimental observation of mode transformation from LP01 to LP11 across scanned WGM resonances is being reported.},

We analyze this coupling-length phase-matching (CLPM) scheme both for second-order frequency conversion, such as second harmonic generation or difference-frequency generation, as well as for third-order four-wave mixing processes, for which we consider the example of generating a longer wavelength by third-order nonlinear mixing of two shorter wavelength waves. Numerous phase-matching conditions are identified in each case. We show that the maximum photon conversion efficiencies reached after an optimum propagation length are always higher than half those obtained for perfect phase matching in a single waveguide, with nearly 100 photon conversion possible for several of the CLPM conditions we studied.},

Once limited to long-haul point-to-point systems, Lucent Technologies is now commercializing multipoint metro WDM ring systems that include software-controlled optical wavelength add/drop multiplexers and soon will offer large optical cross connects. These optical network elements, together with network management software, will enable rapid provisioning of wavelength services, as well as rapid network restoration. In addition, as the cost of optics is driven down and the demand for bandwidth to businesses and residential customers continues to grow, optical systems are extending out from the network core and metro to access applications. The confluence of a proliferation of broadband service applications and rapidly maturing optical technology are literally driving optical systems into all segments. Increasingly, optics is literally everywhere.},

abstract = {The circulation of light within dielectric volumes enables storage of optical power near specific resonant frequencies and is important in a wide range of fields including cavity quantum electrodynamics, photonics, biosensing and nonlinear optics. Optical trajectories occur near the interface of the volume with its surroundings, making their performance strongly dependent upon interface quality. With a nearly atomic-scale surface finish, surface-tension-induced microcavities such as liquid droplets or spheres are superior to all other dielectric microresonant structures when comparing photon lifetime or, equivalently, cavity Q factor. Despite these advantageous properties, the physical characteristics of such systems are not easily controlled during fabrication. It is known that wafer-based processing of resonators can achieve parallel processing and control, as well as integration with other functions. However, such resonators-on-a-chip suffer from Q factors that are many orders of magnitude lower than for surface-tension-induced microcavities, making them unsuitable for ultra-high-Q experiments. Here we demonstrate a process for producing silica toroid-shaped microresonators-on-a-chip with Q factors in excess of 100 million using a combination of lithography, dry etching and a selective reflow process. Such a high Q value was previously attainable only by droplets or microspheres and represents an improvement of nearly four orders of magnitude over previous chip-based resonators.},
