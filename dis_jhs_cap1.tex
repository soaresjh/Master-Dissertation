\chapter{Introduction}

Throughout the history, and prehistory, of humanity, the different eras used to be named in honor of the technology that has largely affected their behavior. Starting with the use of stones as tools to open hard shells and defend from wild animal in the Stone Age~\cite{livescience_2011}, passing through the Oil Age when the oil was discovered as a energy source~\cite{Maugeri_2007}, the Jet Age with the advance of jet-engine~\cite{brit_fly} and lots of remarkable technologies that has changed the curse of the society~\cite{brit_tec}.

Nowadays, it is notorious the amount of new technologies that rise every day; however, mostly of this technologies presents a common base, information. Our smartphones are, more than ever, presents in our life being essential, some times. Internet access is natural enough to not be noticed. More and more devices use personal, environmental and global information to provide the way of life that we know. Although a good description of our Epoch belongs to the future, it is some times called the Age of Information~\cite{TechTarget, NYT_2012, Forbes}, which is a reasonable guess. Tracing back the history we can spot the invention that lead to the rise of all the current information technology, the Optical Fiber.

The use of light to transmit information shortened the distances and extended the channel enabling to much more Data to reach much further than was possible using electronic signal. The Corning Inc., one of the greatest manufacturers of optical fiber, describe the impact of it as \textit{"revolutionized the way the World communicates. Thanks to this technology, we can connect to anyone anywhere... at the speed of light"}\footnote{Exactly comment at \url{https://www.corning.com/in/en/products/communication-networks/products/fiber/optical-fiber-innovation.html}}. However, the optical fiber is just the part of this circuit that transport the information, to produce this information, read it and apply in a useful form we need a whole range of devices, the study of this devices is a field of Photonics.

\section{Photonics}
We can understand as photonics the technology of generating and manipulation light, it can be applied in several areas such 
%Photonics is the technology of generating and harnessing light and other forms of radiant energy whose quantum unit is the photon. Photonics involves cutting-edge uses of lasers, optics, fiber-optics, and electro-optical devices in numerous and diverse fields of technology â€“ alternate energy, manufacturing, health care, telecommunication, environmental monitoring, homeland security, aerospace, solid state lighting, and many others.
