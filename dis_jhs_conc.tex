%The results of the project can be summarized in technical advances and scientifical advances.

We have demonstrated generation of third harmonic in optical microcavities, with a maximum net efficiency of $10^{-5}$. 

The microcavities was fabricated using in-house facilities, which needed of a dedication in develop and describe the process of fabrication of wedge cavity. Even though the $Q$ factory of our cavities is some orders of magnitude lower than those already demonstrated in the literature, it was possible to identify the key problems which enable the group to precisely attack then, turn it spendless to solve. It was possible to describe the dynamics of the coupling of two modes due to third order nonlinearity. The numerical solution of the coupled rate equation showed a well qualitative agreement with the experimental result, and a satisfactory quantitative agreement, despite the limitation on determine the values  

The amount of visible light can by largely improve by increase the coupling between the source and the visible mode, the use of a different bus guide for the visible light was already demonstrated an efficient alternative~\needcit. The input power was a limitation to reach the maximum efficiency regime predicted in the model; however, a improvement in the $Q$ factor should decrease the critical power required enabling the study of the maximum regime efficiency.
